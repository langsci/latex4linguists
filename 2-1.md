# Tasks for class 2-1

- include an image in your article with \includegraphics
- set `[width=\textwidth]`
- set `[height=.3\textheight]`

----
- put your image in the `{figure}` environment
- add a `\caption{}`
- add a `\label{}` after the caption and refer to the image in the surrounding text 
- swap the position of `\caption` and `label{}`, recompile twice and see what happens
- *use the package `subfigure` and try `\subfigure[My caption]{\includegraphics{myfile.jpg}}` inside the `{figure}` environment. 

----
- add a couple of additional images 
- experiment with the placement parameters `[h]`,`[t]`,`[b]`,`[p]`
- try `\documentclass[draft]{scrartcl}`

----
- create a centered 4x4  tabular (1,2,3,4),(5,6,7,8),(9,10,11,12),(13,14,15,16)
- change the column definition to `l` and `r`
- change one column definition to `p{5cm}`
- add some empty lines
- *adjust vertical spacing between lines with `\\[5mm]`

----
- put your tabular in a `{table}` environment
- add a `\caption` and a `\label`
- add an additional tabular within the same `table` environment
- use `~` and `\smallskip` to adjust the spacing of the two tabulars
- try `\centering` at the beginning of the environment

----
- use the package `tabularx`
- add a new table `\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{llll}` with the same content as above
- vary the column definitions between `l`, `r`, `c`, and `X`
- vary the width of the tabular, e.g. `0.66\textwidth`


---- 
- remove one `l` from one of your tabular column definitions. Recompile
- add additional `l`s to one of your tabular definitions. Recompile
- enclose the content of the first cell of the last row in `[...]`


---- 
- use the package `booktabs`
- add `\toprule`, `\midrule`, `\bottomrule` to your tabulars. NB: professional typographers agree that lines should be limited to a minimum 
- replace some `\midrule`s by `\hline`s and inspect the difference

----
- use `\multicol{2}{c}{content for merged cell}` in one of your tables 
- use `\multicol{2}{l}{content for merged cell}` in one of your tables 
- use `\multicol{2}{r}{content for merged cell}` in one of your tables 

----
- use package `multirow`
- use `\multirow{2}{*}{content for merged cell}` in one of your tables 
- use `\multirow{-2}{*}{content for merged cell}` in one of your tables 
- NB: vertical positioning of merged cells is horrible
- repeating the content of cells often works much better than merging

----
- experiment with `\cline` and `\cmidrule` between rows

----
- `\usepackage{colortbl}`
- `\cellcolor{yellow}`
- NB: different shades of grey are normally visually more pleasing than primary colours
