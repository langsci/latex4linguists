## already done
- create two lines with the numbers from 1 to 5 and 1 to 10. Link each integer n from the first line to the integer 2n in the second line
- draw a diagram with your table and your two neighbours' tables to the left and the right
- draw your favourite representation of the semiotic triangle (e.g. symbol-concept-referent)
- draw a network graph of Emma, Denis, Janet, Samira, Gottfried, Jussi, and Wang (represented by circles) with a combination of thick, thin and dashed lines symbolising the strength of the links between them. 

## additions 
- link 1,2,3 in the first line with 3,6,9 in the second. Use a dashed line. 
- link 1,2 in the first line with 4,8 in the second. Use a dotted line

- add two more "tables" above and below Sebastian

- add a couple more people to the network graph and link them to existing people, using a variety of line styles. Change the border color of some bubbles. Fill some bubbles with a color of your choice. 

----
- change the values in the barplot
- add some more columns 

- download the pgfplots manual http://mirrors.ctan.org/graphics/pgf/contrib/pgfplots/doc/pgfplots.pdf
- choose some of the plots on pages 78ff of the manual and copypaste the code into your document. Play around.

----
- use the package todonote
- play around with `\todo{}` and `\todo[inline]{}`

----
- useful structure for a thesis
