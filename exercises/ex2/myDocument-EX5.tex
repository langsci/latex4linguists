\begin{abstract}
	An abstract is a brief summary of a research article, thesis, or any in-depth 
	analysis of a particular subject and is often used to help the reader quickly 
	ascertain the paper's purpose.\par 
	When used, an abstract always appears at the beginning of a manuscript, acting 
	as the point-of-entry for any given academic paper.

\section{Text environments}


\subsection{Quotations}

Use the \texttt{quote} and the \texttt{quotation} environments as to produce the following output and check out the differences.


This is a sentence before the \texttt{quote} environment.
\begin{quote}
	Furthermore, each actual ``language'' will incorporate a periphery of borrowings,
	historical residues, inventions, and so on, which we can hardly expect to -- and
	indeed would not want to -- incorporate within a principled theory of UG. [\dots]
	
	Viewed against the reality of what a particular person may have inside
	his head, core grammar is an idealization.
	\hfill (Chomsky,~1981:~8)
